# Vim rc files

Current repo contains my vim configuration - Decided to keep it as a separate
repo just due to its mere size.

P.S. It's also handy to keep it as a separate repo since I don't have to share the
whole of my dotfiles.

Use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink it to the appropriate locations
